/*
static: Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow	

absolute: The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element	

fixed:	The element is positioned relative to the browser window	

relative: The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position	

sticky:	The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position
A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
	
initial: Sets this property to its default value. Read about initial	

inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element. Read about inherit
